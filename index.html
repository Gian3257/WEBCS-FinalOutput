            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Game development started as a hobby, but it quickly became one 
            of my greatest passions.<br> I began learning game development on 
            my own during 2020 by watching countless YouTube<br> tutorials, 
            experimenting and making various prototype games with the 
            Unity game engine.<br> I’ve found joy in every step of the process and 
            I’m constantly exploring new ideas and bringing<br> them to life 
            through indie game development.<br><br> 

            I primarily work with Unity, which enables me to create interactive 
            and engaging games.<br> I also use Blender for 3D modeling and 
            animation, which allows me to create environments,<br> and assets.<br><br>

            Although I approach game development as a hobby, my projects 
            are built with technical detail.<br> I try to make each game an 
            enjoyable and exciting experience.
